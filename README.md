# Energy Efficiency as a Service with FastAPI

This document explains how to serve a machine learning model as a service using FastAPI, step by step. This example works with a weather energy dataset created using FastAPI and scikit-learn.

## Requirements

Before running the project, you will need the following requirements:

- Python (version 3.7 or newer)
- FastAPI
- Uvicorn
- scikit-learn (or another machine learning library you're using)
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- joblib
- pydantic
- requests
- matplotlib.pyplot


You can install the requirements using the following commands:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn scikit-learn joblib
```

# Running the Project
You can start your FastAPI application with the following command:

```
uvicorn my_fastapi_app:app --reload
```
Once the server is up and running, you can access your application at http://localhost:8000.

# Usage
After launching your application, you can test your model using HTTP clients or API testing tools. Here's an example API request:

```
POST http://localhost:8000/predict/

{
    "X1": 0.74,
    "X2": 6860.0,
    "X3": 2450.0,
    "X4": 140.0,
    "X5": 3.5,
    "X6": 3,
    "X7": 0.0,
    "X8": 0,
    "y1": 15.55,
    "y2": 21.33,
}
```
